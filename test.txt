Test out features of GitHub 

Github Setup
Git is currently the standard for version control software and can be used to track changes in your projects. It allows you to revert to any "commit" and to create branches for experimentation.

GitHub is an online platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It provides a place to host code, track changes to code over time, and collaborate with others on  projects. In this course, you will be using GitHub to create your individual analytics portfolio. You may also want to use it in your group to collaborate on the project.
